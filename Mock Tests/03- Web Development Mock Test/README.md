## ðŸ’¡ Question: Explain all the CSS positions(static, fixed, sticky, relative, absolute) with one code example each

### ðŸš€ Answer:

**CSS provides several positioning options for elements. Understanding these positions is essential for controlling the layout and positioning of elements on a web page. Here are the commonly used CSS positions:**

## 1. Static:

- The default position value in CSS is "static".
- Elements with a static position are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.

**Example:**

```html
<style>
  .box {
    background-color: lightblue;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
  }
</style>

<div class="box">Static Position</div>
```

## 2. Fixed:

- Elements with a fixed position are positioned relative to the browser window.
- They will stay in the same position even if the page is scrolled.

**Example:**

```html
<style>
  .box {
    background-color: lightblue;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    position: fixed;
    top: 20px;
    left: 20px;
  }
</style>

<div class="box">Fixed Position</div>
```

## 3. Sticky:

- Elements with a sticky position are positioned based on the user's scroll position.
- They behave like "fixed" until a specified scroll position is reached, then they become "relative" and start scrolling with the rest of the content.

**Example:**

```html
<style>
  .box {
    background-color: lightblue;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    position: sticky;
    top: 20px;
  }
</style>

<div class="box">Sticky Position</div>
```

## 4. Relative:

- Elements with a relative position are positioned relative to their normal position.
- They can be moved using the top, right, bottom, and left properties.

**Example:**

```html
<style>
  .box {
    background-color: lightblue;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    position: relative;
    top: 20px;
    left: 20px;
  }
</style>

<div class="box">Relative Position</div>
```

## 5. Absolute:

- Elements with an absolute position are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor.
- If there is no positioned ancestor, they are positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the browser window).

**Example:**

```html
<style>
  .container {
    position: relative;
    height: 300px;
    width: 500px;
  }

  .box {
    background-color: lightblue;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    position: absolute;
    top: 20px;
    left: 20px;
  }
</style>

<div class="container">
  <div class="box">Absolute Position</div>
</div>
```

        var phone = document.getElementById("phone").value;
        var password = document.getElementById("password").value;
        var age = document.getElementById("age").value;
        var gender = document.getElementById("gender").value;
        var date = document.getElementById("date").value;
        var color = document.getElementById("color").value;

        // Basic validation
        if (
          name === "" ||
          email === "" ||
          phone === "" ||
          password === "" ||
          age === "" ||
          gender === "" ||
          date === "" ||
          color === ""
        ) {
          alert("Please fill in all fields.");
          return;
        }

        // Additional validation rules can be added here

        // If all validations pass, you can submit the form
        document.getElementById("myForm").submit();
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## ðŸ’¡ Question: Explain what is execution context in detail with diagram

### ðŸš€ Answer:

**Execution context is an important concept in JavaScript that helps manage the execution of code. It provides an environment in which JavaScript code is executed and variables, functions, and objects are stored and accessed. Each time a function is called or a block of code is executed, a new execution context is created.**

### There are three types of execution contexts in JavaScript:

- **Global Execution Context:** The global execution context is the default and outermost context. It is created when the JavaScript code starts executing. In a browser, the global execution context represents the global scope and includes global variables, functions, and objects. It is accessible throughout the entire JavaScript code.

- **Function Execution Context:** When a function is called, a new function execution context is created. It represents the local scope of the function. The function execution context includes local variables, function arguments, and any nested functions or blocks within the function. Each function call creates a new function execution context, and when the function finishes executing, its execution context is destroyed.

- **Eval Execution Context:** The eval function in JavaScript can execute code dynamically. When the eval function is called, a new eval execution context is created. It is similar to the function execution context, but it operates within the scope where the eval function is called.

### The execution context consists of three main components:

- **Variable Environment:** The variable environment contains all the variables declared within the context, including function arguments and local variables. It also includes function declarations (hoisted functions) and the value of the this keyword.

- **Scope Chain:** The scope chain is a list of variables and functions that the current execution context has access to. It allows JavaScript to resolve variable names by searching through the scope chain until a match is found. The scope chain is created based on the lexical (static) scope of functions and the order of their nested definitions.

- **Lexical Environment:** The lexical environment is a combination of the variable environment and the reference to the outer environment. The outer environment points to the parent execution context, establishing the scope chain and allowing access to variables in the outer context.
