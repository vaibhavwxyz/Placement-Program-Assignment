## ðŸ’¡ Q.1 <!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it?

### ðŸš€ Answer

> **No**, `<!DOCTYPE html>` is not an HTML tag. It is a declaration used at the beginning of an HTML document to specify the document type and version. It informs the web browser about the version of HTML being used, allowing it to interpret and render the page correctly.
